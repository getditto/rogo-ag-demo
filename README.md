# Local React App Small Peer to NodeJS Small Peer

* The React App is in the `./web` directory
* The NodeJS small peer is in the `./server` directory

## Setting up

1. Make sure you have Node 16 or higher (this isn't necessary for Ditto, it is just easier for this project)
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the packages in `./web` and `./server`
3. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in  `./web` and `./server`
4. The web app will start on http://localhost:3000, navigate to this in your browser. 
5. The server app will start on http:localhost:4000

Experiment with the code and give it a try!
